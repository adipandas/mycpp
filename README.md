# mycpp
Some of my C++ codes done during the practice.

## How to use

Install the following dependencies using the terminal.
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo aptâˆ’get install g++
sudo apt install build-essential
```

To use the codes provided in all the folders, the procedure is pretty much the same unless specified otherwise. You can build and run the code in any folder using the following commands in the terminal:

```
cd ~/
git clone git@github.com:adipandas/mycpp.git

cd ~/mycpp/p<number>_<name>
g++ main.cpp

./a.out
```

### Follow the content of this folder in the following order:

1. [oop - Some CPP fundamentals and object oriented programming](oop/)
2. [Memory management fundamentals](memory_management/)
3. [Concurrency Fundamentals](concurrency/)
4. [Simple CMAKE examples](cmake_examples/)

###### Note: These codes were tested on Ubuntu 18.04
