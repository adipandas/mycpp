# mycpp

Some of my C++ codes done during the practice.


## How to use

To use the codes, the procedure is pretty much the same unless specified otherwise.

You can build code in any folder using the terminal as follows:
```
cd ~/
git clone git@github.com:adipandas/mycpp.git

cd ~/mycpp/p<number>_<name>
g++ main.cpp

./a.out
```

You can run the code after building as follows:
```
cd ~/mycpp/p<number>_<name>

./a.out
```

#### Note: These codes were tested on Ubuntu 18.04.
